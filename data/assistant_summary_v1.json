    "Good morning, Polina. Two things need attention today: a shipment slot confirmation from Anna Müller and an invoice that’s due tomorrow to avoid service disruption.",
    "There are a few quick wins: Mark is waiting for a pricing clarification, and Support can close your ticket once you confirm the address.",
    "You also have documents in the inbox — a tax form and offer details — worth skimming when you have a calm window."
